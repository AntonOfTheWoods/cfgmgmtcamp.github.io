        <p>
          In tradition with other
          <a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/fringe/">FOSS events</a> there are a
          couple of events on the "Fringe" of Config Management Camp.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the same venue as Config Management Camp we are hosting:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#foreman">Foreman Construction Day</a></li>
            <a name="foreman"></a>

            <li><a href="#habitat">Habitat &amp; InSpec Hackday</a></li>
            <li><a href="#mgmt">Mgmt Hackathon</a></li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Foreman Construction Day</h2>
        <h3>Wednesday, February 7, 10:00 - 16:30, Room TBD</h3>

        <p>
          Foreman will be holding its third Foreman Construction Day on
          Wednesday 7th February 2018, which is the day after Config Management
          Camp.
        </p>

        <p>
          The aim is to build upon on the previous 2-4 days of talks and
          discussions, and put it to use! We're open to all members of our
          community, such as

          <ul>
            <li>New users looking for help getting started with Foreman</li>
            <li>Users looking to start contributing</li>
            <li>Code contributors to any of the core projects</li>
            <li>Puppet coders for the installer</li>
            <li>Plugin authors (new or existing plugins)</li>
            <a name="puppet"></a>
            <li>Translators / documentors</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a great opportunity to get (more) involved in the community,
          and spend some face-to-face hack time with other Foreman devs. Hope to
          see you there!

        <h2>Habitat &amp; InSpec Hackday</h2>
        <h3>Wednesday, February 7, 10:00 - 16:30, Room TBD</h3>

        <p>
          <a href="https://www.habitat.sh/">Habitat</a> is a simple, flexible
          way to build, deploy, and manage cloud native applications.
          <a href="https://www.inspec.io/">InSpec</a> is an open-source testing
          framework for infrastructure with a human-readable language for
          specifying compliance, security and other policy requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will break into small, self-selected working groups to hack on
          habitizing an application, using InSpec to validate a system, or other
          automation-related projects of your choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          No Habitat or InSpec experience is required!  It is not necessary to
          install anything in advance but you will be able to get going sooner
          if you have already installed the
          <a href="https://downloads.chef.io/chefdk">Chef Development Kit</a>,
          <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, and
          <a href="https://www.habitat.sh/tutorials/download/">Habitat</a>.  We
          will introduce you to the concepts and get you some time with hands-on
          Habitat and/or InSpec.
        </p>
