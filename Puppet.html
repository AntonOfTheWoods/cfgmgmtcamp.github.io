          <h1 id="about">Puppet Contributor Summit</h1>
                <p>The Puppet community has been growing very quickly over the past two years. At early Puppet Camps, we had mostly contributors working together on ways to make Puppet better, but as the community has grown, our Puppet Camps have attracted so many new users that it's become difficult for established contributors to find a place to collaborate together.</p>
                <p>The plan is to hold two contributor summits per year with the first one at CfgMgmtCamp.eu and the second at PuppetConf. We want this event to attract both existing and new contributors to Puppet, related projects and modules. We hope to get existing contributors more engaged, encourage new contributions, and improve our processes for working with community contributors.</p>
                <p><strong>Who should attend</strong></p>
                <ul>
                   <li>People who have submitted pull requests and contribute code to our projects.</li>
                   <li>Community members working on related projects (Dashboard, Puppetboard, Foreman, etc.)</li>
                   <li>Module developers and publishers.</li>
                   <li>Key community members who answer a lot of questions about using Puppet.</li>
                   <li>Long-time Puppet users who are interested in doing more.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can contact Dawn Foster for questions about this event. Her email address is dawn@ the Puppet Labs domain.</p> 
           <h1 id="submit">Submit a Proposal</h1>
                <p>Submissions are due <strong>November 15, 2013</strong>.</p>
                <p>Your talk should be focused on contributors, instead of users. Talks about general best practices for using Puppet or case studies about how you use Puppet in your environment aren't likely to be accepted unless you are talking about how you have customized or contributed to Puppet in some way to make this happen.</p>
                <p><strong>We plan to have 3 types of talks at the Contributor Summit</strong></p>
                <ul>
                   <li>Modules - developing modules and advanced module development & testing</li>
                   <li>Core - advanced topics and contributing to Puppet / related projects</li>
                   <li>Community projects - applied Puppet and all of the awesome things people build to work with Puppet</li>
                </ul> 
               <p>Please keep these areas in mind when you submit a talk. You can use the form below of go <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHlSek1BY2FkQ3VTUXJZY3psV0dLaHc6MA">directly to the form</a> to submit.</p>
